,
2019-09-14 19:51:09+00:00,Good analysis. You can order commercial solar in literally 30 secs if you use Apple Pay at http://Tesla.com/bigsolar.
,
2019-09-14 19:33:39+00:00,"Exactly! We’ve only one car factory in California & one Gigafactory (for batteries & drive units) in Nevada. Giga Shanghai will do cars, batteries & drive units for the greater China area. Over time, regional Gigafactories will lower costs & improve logistics worldwide."
,
2019-09-14 17:59:08+00:00,"Should note that these product mix & logistics errors also results in regional *undersupply*, eg UK & Ireland right now, but we don’t raise the prices even so. The intent, at any given moment in time, is: heads we lose, tails buyers win."
,
2019-09-14 17:53:24+00:00,"That’s not to say that Tesla people somewhere in the world are being overzealous & possibly overstepping our core principles, which is why I’m looking into it"
,
2019-09-14 17:51:01+00:00,"At end of quarter, there is always some error in product mix allocation between the roughly 40 global regions, due to planning mistakes & logistics problems (Earth is a big place). Small changes in prices are needed to correct local supply/demand imbalances."
,
2019-09-14 17:45:58+00:00,"The fundamental operating principle is that prices, while they may change, will change for all equally & should never be a function of bargaining. This is normal for most products, but weirdly not for the auto industry in most parts of the world."

,
2019-09-14 17:03:08+00:00,"There aren’t really meant to be “Tesla incentives”, just general price changes to reflect optimal value of product, as we sometimes get prices of some variants wrong or need to (partially) address shifts in tax incentives. Overarching principle, however, is same deal for all."
,
2019-09-14 16:56:24+00:00,"Looking into this. A fundamental premise of Tesla is that everyone is offered same terms at same time, ie what you get should never be a function of bargaining."

,
2019-09-22 17:06:46+00:00,"Stability is controlled by (very) rapid movement of rear & fwd fins during entry & landing, as well as ACS thrusters. The smaller leeward “fin” would simply be used as a leg."

,
2019-09-24 18:10:42+00:00,"Exactly. For reusable heatshield, minimize peak heating. For ablative/expendable, minimize total heat. Therefore reusable like Starship wants lift during high Mach reentry for lower peak, but higher total heat."

,
2020-04-16 01:50:01+00:00,"Tesla actually sent out ResMed, Philips & Medtronic units. Latter is fully intratracheal. My personal opinion is that some ICUs are jumping the gun on intubation & setting PEEP & O2 too high. High pressure, pure oxygen increases risk of lung damage."

,
2020-04-16 01:28:44+00:00,"Exactly. In mid 2009, Tesla received non-binding approval for loan program actually signed into law by Bush in late 2008. First actual disbursement was Q2 2010, long after BK danger passed. Loan was repaid early with interest. Taxpayers made money on it!!"
,
2020-04-16 01:22:50+00:00,"Last I checked, over a million dollars less. Moreover, F9 is launching far more often & is only rocket fully NASA-approved for launching astronauts, so that gap is increasing."

,
2020-04-25 11:58:12+00:00,That basically describes SoC 0 vs SoC 1 of our FSD computer right now. Soon to change!
,

,
2020-04-25 11:48:01+00:00,Improved process I was referring to was cylinder to cylinder circumferential welds to improve cycle time & reduce pucker. Those are still working their way through production.
,
2020-04-25 11:42:43+00:00,These won’t be strictly coupled to ship serial number. Might be on SN5 or might just be used as a manufacturing pathfinder.
,
2020-04-25 10:50:09+00:00,Great labeling tools & talented human labelers really matter. It really is a skilled profession! Importance of good tools & infrastructure is underrated.

,
2020-04-25 10:10:46+00:00,Pretty much. Being better than human drivers on average is not a super high standard. Autonomy will probably be held to a 300% to 1000% higher safety requirement long-term.

,
2020-04-25 04:20:51+00:00,Many talented engineers are working on FSD at Tesla. What matters is solving vision at high frame rate in our compute space with low latency between camera frame & actuation.

,
2020-06-11 09:32:03+00:00,TRUE
,
2020-06-11 09:15:13+00:00,"Battery industry is world champion at bs. “Lithium-ion” doesn’t really mean anything. What matters is cathode & anode material. There are many choices, but nickel cathode with carbon-silicon anode works great."
,
2020-06-11 09:05:01+00:00,I thought this was an Onion article
,
2020-06-11 09:00:21+00:00,Staggeringly dumb
,
2020-06-11 08:48:53+00:00,I got the fuel cell question about 8000 times
,
2020-06-11 08:11:24+00:00,It’s getting Biblical
,
2020-06-11 08:10:31+00:00,"Exactly, fuel cells = fool sells"
,
2020-06-11 06:35:23+00:00,Renewable energy passed coal in April https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=39992
,
2020-06-11 01:08:54+00:00,Worth considering
,
2020-06-11 01:07:06+00:00,Agreed
,
2020-06-14 19:57:57+00:00,It will get even simpler. Just two instructions for Starlink: plug in & point at sky. Can be done in either order.
,
2020-06-14 06:09:21+00:00,Congratulations Kathy!
,
2020-06-15 23:53:26+00:00,Tesla Model S now first ever electric vehicle to receive EPA range rating above 400 miles!
,
2020-06-15 23:38:44+00:00,Absolutely
,
2020-06-15 23:36:49+00:00,China & Asia Pacific Supercharger usage above pre-covid highs. North America catching up fast. Europe slightly behind.
,
2020-06-15 23:30:06+00:00,Looking likely
,
2020-06-15 22:21:25+00:00,"Throttling is done by adjusting flow to the ox and fuel preburners. The lower limit of thrust is ox & fuel turbopump injector preburner “stiffness”, essentially when do the preburner elements start flaming out."
,
2020-06-15 22:06:44+00:00,"Tank didn’t burst, but leaked at 7.6 bar. This is a good result & supports idea of 304L stainless being better than 301. We’re developing our own alloy to take this even further. Leak before burst is highly desirable."
,
2020-06-15 21:56:42+00:00,"Yeah. Merlin, using a single pintle injector with cold, liquid propellant, needs a longer chamber than Raptor, which uses a large number of coaxial injectors, despite Merlin being less than half thrust. Propellant enters Raptor chamber as hot gas that’s already mixed."
,
2020-06-15 20:20:13+00:00,Yes
,
2020-06-15 20:19:45+00:00,"That’s the goal. There a few known weak points on this test tank, probably capable of more pressure. The second test tank to follow shortly has addressed the weak points."
,
2020-06-15 19:39:12+00:00,Accurate
,
2020-06-15 03:08:45+00:00,Sure
,
2020-06-15 03:01:04+00:00,"Around 20ms. It’s designed to run real-time, competitive video games. Version 2, which is at lower altitude could be as low as 8ms latency."
,
2020-06-16 21:19:26+00:00,It will be real
,
2020-06-16 20:45:36+00:00,Maybe Incat https://mashable.com/2013/06/29/worlds-fastest-ship-jet-engines-francisco/
,
2020-06-16 20:33:44+00:00,There will be many test flights before commercial passengers are carried. First Earth to Earth test flights might be in 2 or 3 years.
,
2020-06-16 20:11:46+00:00,We need to be far enough away so as not to bother heavily populated areas. The launch & landing are not subtle. But you could get within a few miles of the spaceport in a boat.
,
2020-06-16 19:32:39+00:00,"Directionally correct, but Zenit is an order of magnitude smaller than Starship system & doesn’t come back & land"
,
2020-06-16 19:24:24+00:00,"US law requires at least a green card to be hired at SpaceX, as rockets are considered advanced weapons technology"
,
2020-06-16 19:23:06+00:00,Pretty much
,
2020-06-16 19:22:09+00:00,Illuminaughty haha
,
2020-06-16 19:20:04+00:00,"SpaceX is building floating, superheavy-class spaceports for Mars, moon & hypersonic travel around Earth"
,
2020-06-16 17:32:11+00:00,Maybe some Flextape
,
2020-06-16 17:25:52+00:00,"No problem, we can buff it out"
,
2020-06-16 16:45:52+00:00,Fairing reuse is looking good
,
2020-06-16 16:43:30+00:00,So where are the aliens?
,
2020-06-16 11:40:06+00:00,Or Y
,
2020-06-16 11:39:13+00:00,No larger pack Model 3 is in development
,
2020-06-16 07:13:48+00:00,"Actually, we’ve made slight changes, but the range improvement is >90% efficiency"
,
2020-06-16 07:09:09+00:00,Cool
,
2020-06-16 07:06:06+00:00,Physics doesn’t care about politicians
,
2020-06-16 02:08:53+00:00,Coming soon
,
2020-06-16 02:07:13+00:00,All Model S cars made since late Jan have 402 mile range. This is just making it official.
,
2020-06-17 00:04:44+00:00,Not sure. They’re pretty close together.
,
2020-06-18 23:18:48+00:00,
,
2020-06-18 23:05:06+00:00, 
,
2020-06-18 23:04:30+00:00,We are considering several options
,
2020-06-18 19:39:59+00:00,"Tesla has an option to purchase this land, but has not exercised it"
,
2020-06-18 17:03:42+00:00,Renewable energy is happening fast
,
2020-06-18 13:21:17+00:00,Comes standard with Cybertruck
,
2020-06-19 17:42:11+00:00,"It does require use of a paid-time-off day, which is true of many other holidays"
,
2020-06-19 17:06:03+00:00,Juneteenth is henceforth considered a US holiday at Tesla & SpaceX
,
2020-06-19 17:03:43+00:00,Moving fast
,
2020-06-19 16:40:55+00:00,Opening in about two weeks
,
2020-06-19 06:52:59+00:00,Reaching chamber pressure of 300 atmospheres
,
2020-06-19 06:18:23+00:00,Confirmed
,
2020-06-20 20:13:43+00:00,Feels so long ago
,
2020-06-20 19:46:03+00:00,Pulling up to The Petersen
,
2020-06-20 02:56:56+00:00,Nice
,
2020-06-20 02:24:26+00:00,We will add one more PTO day after the annual review next quarter
,
2020-06-20 02:02:34+00:00,It will look a little odd
,
2020-06-20 01:51:14+00:00,Probably Fremont
,
2020-06-20 01:46:46+00:00,"Probably good to combine them, since they are converging in time. I’m hopeful we can announce a date after the July 4th week."
,
2020-06-20 01:36:54+00:00,"Yes, but we will have to postpone annual shareholder meeting, as still no large gatherings allowed by July 7th. Not sure of new date, but am guessing maybe a month or so later."
,
2020-06-20 01:31:33+00:00,Stop by The Petersen is you’d like to see Cybertruck irl! Lots of awesome cars & bikes there. Definitely worth seeing with or without Cybertruck.
