2019-06-26 22:21:26+00:00,Almost anything. Length/diameter is much lower & Starship doesn’t have a hammerhead fairing that acts like main sail.
2019-06-26 22:18:24+00:00,Falcon 9 right now is kind of weak when it comes to upper level winds due to it being so long and thin. I know Starship will be more resistant to them but what are the current estimates on what Starship will be able to handle regarding upper level winds?
2019-06-26 22:15:14+00:00,You’re touching on a good critique of Falcon 9. Our 1st stage to 2nd stage propellant ratio is too high. We’re fixing that with Starship.

2020-01-30 23:00:44+00:00,"Exactly. Mars propellant production will combine atmospheric CO2 & water (ice) to make CH4 (methane) & O2. Will do same on Earth long-term.

2020-02-20 23:54:53+00:00,F9 iteration slowed down as payloads became too important to risk. Little change is expected going forward with F9/FH or Dragon. Starship production & thus iterative improvement will be much faster than Falcon. Driving hard for fully reusable orbital flight this year!

2020-02-20 23:31:04+00:00,These problems are fundamentally intertwined. Building many rockets allows for successive approximation. Progress in any given technology is simply #of iterations * progress between iterations.
